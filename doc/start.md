#swape php framework#

###Why another PHP framework?###

This is unlike other big frameworks. This framework does not force you to use MVC type of programming unless you want it to be a MVC. Nor does it make you use a specific template engine.

You can choose what you like and prefer to develop your application.

Nomaly I have used this framework with **Angular / Ember / jQuery** and used this as a both REST api and/or the system. 
I have used it with number of template systems and PHP as a template system.

So why should the framework tell you how to forge awesome application and force you to do stuff you normaly don't?

This framework have some guidelines but you are free to use some or all of the files in your project.
